One of my favorite parts of the Javascript ecosystem is the opportunity for sharing code
between different types of deployments: Web, Native, Desktop, Backend. Here are some
reflections on building a moderately sized application using React and React Native.

## Don't try to share UI code

There are efforts in the React/React Native community to write components once
and render them natively and for the web, ie: [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/).

When thinking about responsive web components in React, it is already a lot of overhead to
make a website that looks good at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints. Considerations for UI
and layout on desktop are completely different from a mobile experience. As such, it is not
incredibly useful to try to have a single UI that looks great on web and mobile. I found
that as long as I am able to reuse most of my non-UI code, I could compose UIs very quickly
while also having the freedom to make applications that look great on desktop and native.

Here is a list of non-UI code that I found incredibly useful to share:

- Non-UI components
- Request hooks ([React Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query))
- Schemas for validation ([Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod))
- Stores ([Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand))
- Typescript types
- Utils (String/Date formatting, Generic functions)

## Requests will be different

For my project, I used [React Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query) extensively. If you are
unfamiliar with React Query, it's a hook based library for making requests, and it has a ton of
configuration for caching data, refetching, background actions, and much more.

#### Caching requests

In the web and native versions of the application, I preferred a Query Client configuration that fetched
any requests for a page every time that page loaded. This ensured that when a user viewed any
page, they always had the most up to date information. My Query Client setup looked like this:

```ts
new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      retry: false,
      // refetch requests when mounting (page loads for the first time)
      refetchOnMount: true,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      // keep the fetched requests forever in cache to prevent unnecessary refetching
      staleTime: Infinity,
    },
  },
});
```

This setup essentially says that requests should be fetched once per page load, and then cached forever.
If I needed to make an update to cached data, it was very easy to call `client.invalidateQueries` to
force a request to be refetched. This worked great for having dependent data be updated after a successful
POST request.

#### Refetching for native

Many native applications use a "pull to refresh" pattern for updating the content in the current view.
React Query made it very easy to expose a `refetch` function as part of the request hooks that I could
call from React Native's `ScrollView` "refreshControl" prop.

```tsx
<ScrollView
  refreshControl={
    <RefreshControl refreshing={isRefetching} onRefresh={refetch} />
  }
>
  {/* your content */}
</ScrollView>
```

This `refetch` functionality remained unused in the web version of the application, but since
it is just one more property to expose from React Query's `useQuery` hook, it made it really
easy to use the refetch functionality when I needed it in the native application.

## Use a Monorepo

I used [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces) to create
a pretty simple package structure that looked like this:

```bash
/packages
  /native
  /shared
  /web
```

The "native" package contained the React Native/Expo codebase. The "web" package contained
the Nextjs codebase. The "shared" package contained all of the code that was shared between
web and native. However, I let the web and native applications handle the compilation/transpilation
of the shared package, without having to jump through the hoops of needing to build the shared
package in a way that it was compatible with web and native targets.

#### Web (Nextjs)

Using the [transpilePackages](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/transpilePackages)
configuration, it was very easy to have the shared package be built in exactly the same
way that the rest of the web application was built.

```ts
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  transpilePackages: ['shared'],
};
```

#### Native (React Native/Expo)

React Native with Expo/Metro was a bit more tricky, but by using the `extraNodeModules` property
in the Expo/Metro configuration I was able to add the "shared" package as an additional
node modules directory so that it would get compiled/transpiled with the rest of the React
Native application.

## Use Context/Providers for Equivalent Functionality With Different Implementations

- storage (AsyncStorage vs sessionStorage/localStorage/cookies)

## Container Components and UI Components
